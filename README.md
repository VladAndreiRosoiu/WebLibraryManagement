# WebLibraryManagement

Web library management application, using MYSQL database and Spring. 
Everything is stored in an mysql database and the app is using Hibernate to map db objects. Also, I am using Spring Security, ThymeLeaf and Bootstrap.
Still in development, the app will allow login/registration, 2 types of users (client and librarian), each with specific logic.
